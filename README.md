## Fire Hydrant Detection and Classification System for Urban Safety

---

### ðŸ“‹ Background Information

Fire hydrants play a critical role in urban fire response systems. However, locating hydrants quickly in complex urban environments can be challenging. Currently, manual methods are used to locate fire hydrants, which are time-consuming and prone to delays. This project aims to address these limitations by developing an AI-based system capable of detecting and classifying fire hydrants in real time.

### ðŸŽ¯ Project Description

This project aims to develop an AI-based fire hydrant detection system capable of identifying and classifying fire hydrants in real time. By accurately detecting fire hydrants' locations, the system can support emergency responses, reduce delays, and enhance urban fire safety.

### ðŸš§ Current Limitations

- **Diverse Fire Hydrant Appearance:** Fire hydrants vary widely in color, size, and shape depending on the region, requiring extensive training data for accurate detection.
- **Complex Environments:** Fire hydrants are often partially obscured by vehicles, buildings, or other objects, which can impact detection performance.

---

### ðŸ“¹ Dataset Acquisition

- Images of fire hydrants were collected from diverse urban environments, including:
  - Streets
  - Residential areas
  - Industrial zones
- The dataset includes scenarios with:
  - Lighting variations (day and night)
  - Partial occlusions caused by vehicles or objects
  - Fire hydrants captured from different angles

### ðŸ“‚ Project Progress

#### **1. Image Preprocessing**
- Fire hydrant images were resized to **640 x 640** resolution to ensure compatibility with YOLOv5.

    <img src="image1.png" width="400"/> 
    <img src="image2.png" width="400"/>
</p>

#### **2. Annotation with DarkLabel**
- **DarkLabel.exe** was used to annotate fire hydrants' positions in the dataset.
- Annotations were saved in `.txt` format following YOLOv5 requirements.
